# Simulation analysis

## 1. Independent data simulation analysis

Execute `1.Simulation_independent.R` to obtain the FDR, Power and heterogeneity for `PALM` and compared methods using simulated independent data.

## 2. Longitudinal data simulation analysis

Execute `2.Simulation_longitudinal.R` to oobtain the FDR, Power and heterogeneity for `PALM` and compared methods using simulated longitudinal data.

## 3. Poisson-like methods simulation analysis

Execute `3.Simulation_Poisson.R` to obtain the FDR, Power and heterogeneity for `PALM` and compared Poisson-like methods using simulated independent data.
