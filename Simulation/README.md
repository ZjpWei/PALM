# Simulation Analysis

## 1. Independent Data Simulation Analysis

Run `1.Simulation_independent.R` to calculate FDR, Power, and heterogeneity for PALM and compared methods using simulated independent data.

## 2. Longitudinal Data Simulation Analysis

Run `2.Simulation_longitudinal.R` to calculate FDR, Power, and heterogeneity for PALM and compared methods using simulated longitudinal data.

## 3. Poisson-like Methods Simulation Analysis

Run `3.Simulation_Poisson.R` to calculate FDR, Power, and heterogeneity for PALM and compared Poisson-like methods using simulated independent data.
