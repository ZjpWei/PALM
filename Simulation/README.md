# Simulation analysis

## 1. Independent data simulation analysis

Execute `1.Simulation_independent.R` to obtain the analysis results for `PALM` and compared methods using simulated independent data.

## 2. Longitudinal data Simulation analysis

Execute `2.Simulation_longitudinal.R` to obtain the analysis results for `PALM` and compared methods using simulated longitudinal data.

## 3. Poisson-like methods simluation analysis

Execute `3.Simulation_Poisson.R` to obtain the analysis results for `PALM` and Poisson-like methods using simulated independent data.
